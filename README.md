Objectives of the module
We will analyze a dataset provided by an e-commerce marketplace called Olist to answer the CEO's question:

How could Olist increase its profit?

Olist is a leading e-commerce service that connects merchants to main marketplaces in Brazil. They provide a wide range of offers including inventory management, dealing with reviews and customer contacts to logistic services.

Olist charges sellers a monthly fee. This fee is progressive with the volume of orders.

Here are the seller and customer workflows:

Seller:

Seller joins Olist
Seller uploads products catalogue
Seller gets notified when a product is sold
Seller hands over an item to the logistic carrier
👉 Note that multiple sellers can be involved in one customer order!

Customer:

Browses products on the marketplace
Purchases products from Olist.store
Gets an expected date for delivery
Receives the order
Leaves a review about the order
👉 A review can be left as soon as the order is sent, meaning that a customer can leave a review for an order he did not receive yet!
